this is a pretty INSECURE way to make issues sent to your gitlab project.
Giving your own token with full privilege here IS DEFINITELY NOT SECURE. It can be grabbed by any (even very bad) hacker and give him access to your whole projects on gitlab.
So you SHOULD create a secondary account with only GUEST PRIVILEGE and grab corresponding token here. So the hacker will "only" spam your issue box until you reset token.
